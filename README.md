Autoswitch the keyboard layout when changing between question and answer field (Linux + X11 only)

Layouts can be set in the deck option ("general" tab)

Be aware: parsing the currently used keyboard layout is very difficult - this might mess up your settings if you use layout variants.

Windows support has been added:

Requirements: 

*a version of Anki compiled against PyQt5 (currently only the alpha builds come with PyQt5 on Windows)

*pywin32 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)
