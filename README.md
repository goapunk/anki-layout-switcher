#Anki layout switcher

##Linux (X11) and Windows only 

Autoswitch the keyboard layout when changing between question and answer field

Layouts can be set in the deck option ("general" tab)

Rudimentary Windows (10 - didn't test it on anything else) support has been added:

**Be aware, this might mess up your layout on Windows (I didn't really test it)**

**Requirements:** 

* a version of Anki compiled against PyQt5 (currently only the alpha builds come with PyQt5 on Windows)
* pywin32 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)
